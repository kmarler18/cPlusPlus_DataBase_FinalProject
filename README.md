# cPlusPlus_DataBase_FinalProject
This was the program I developed for my final project in my Introduction to Problem Solving and Computer Programming class.
The class focused on the C++ Programming Language. It was my first experience with any coding language.


I was tasked with creating a program that incorporated all of the techniques we had learned during the semester.


Within the program, I was required to use a switch, two types of loops and create and utilize a file stream object to read and write data from a file.
Additionally, I had to use at least 3 functions (one of which had to be overloaded), a 2D array and some type of user input validation. 

I earned a 100% on the project from my professor <a href="https://github.com/bowmanmc" target="_blank">Michael Bowman</a>.
